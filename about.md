<h1>Bio</h1> Hi, my name is Hays Stanford. I'm an unconventional guy with too much enthusiasm who is here to teach you how to succeed in the Silicon Valley tech scene with a minimum wage income. 

I stopped attending highschool at the age of 16 and started classes at a community college in Austin, TX right when I turned 17. Eventually I transferred into The University of Texas at Austin, only to drop out in order to try to start a tech startup in Silicon Valley. College sucks in all the wrong ways.
