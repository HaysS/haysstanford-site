This site allows anyone to freely view my insights, triumphs, and struggles. My goal is to be as transparent as possible. It is my hope that you will be able to get a better understanding of what it may look like for you to go on a similar journey.

<h1>Bio</h1> 
Hi, my name is Hays Stanford. I'm an unconventional guy with too much enthusiasm who is here to teach you how to succeed in the Silicon Valley tech scene with a minimum wage income. 

I stopped attending highschool at the age of 16 and started classes at a community college in Austin, TX after turning 17. A few semesters later, I transferred into UT Austin, only to drop out in order to try to start a tech business in Silicon Valley.
