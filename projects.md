<h1>Ice Breakerr - Meet anyone before you see their pictures</h1>
<a href="http://www.icebreakerr.com/">http://www.icebreakerr.com</a>

Ice Breakerr is a mobile app that matches people based on expressive personalized profiles first, later showing personal pictures and other superficial credentials after 5 messages are received in a mutual chat with a match. 

These are the only things shown on initial profiles: Any animated GIF on Imgur (under 1.5mb), gender, age, custom text, emojis, and distance from the user's location.

<h1>ClothWear Backpack - Play any animated GIF on your backpack</h1>

Built a backpack that allows you to play any 32x32px animated GIF file from a microSD card. Had an eCommerce store at the domain clothwear.us where I was selling these.

Soldered all of them myself, but I couldn't get the cost low enough for the target market. However, there was definitely a demand in the festival/EDM scene for this product, and I still believe it could make money if someone had the funds to buy wholesale and optimize the design.

This project did lead me to make over $5k in revenue from flipping items from thrift stores and selling custom products on eBay and Amazon.

If you want one, I will still send it to you for $180. Just email me: <a href="mailto:haysstanford@gmail.com">haysstanford@gmail.com</a>
